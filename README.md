# open-chromatin-analysis

This project explores the conservation and functional significance of open chromatin regions across human and mouse tissues, such as the ovary and pancreas. Open chromatin regions play a crucial role in regulating gene expression by providing access to transcriptional machinery.  

Our goals are to:  
- Evaluate the quality of chromatin accessibility datasets. (ATAC-seq)
- Identify and compare open chromatin regions across species and tissues.
- Analyze conserved regulatory elements such as enhancers and promoters.
- Investigate associated biological processes and transcription factor binding sites.
